In Next.js 15, using the `app` directory with dynamic routes and nested layouts can lead to unexpected hydration mismatches.  If a component within a nested layout depends on data fetched at a parent route level, and that data changes between the parent and child route renders, the child component might not re-render with the updated data, leading to a hydration mismatch. This is especially tricky if the child component doesn't directly receive the data as a prop but rather accesses it via context or a global state management solution. For instance, if a data fetching function is triggered at the page level and the layout depends on its result, the layout might not update if a subsequent page navigation changes that data.
